# Data Structures and Algorithms 
This repository is a collection of great mini projects on data structures and algorithms. The aim of the repository is to demonstrate and apply the algorithms in simple and efficient way and to clear the concepts as much as possible.

# Contents
Currently four language are available and many more to come.
* C++
* GO
* JAVA
* Python

Feel free to add more............

# Structure
This repositry not based on a particular language. It contains various programming languages. 

Browse through the repositiry to explore and learn stuff. This repo also contains the Big - O cheatsheet for all types Data Structures and also for the basic algorithmic stuff like various types of sorting algorithms.

Link to cheatsheet [Big-O Cheatsheet](https://github.com/manjunani/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/master/big-%20o%20cheatsheet.png)

Here are some direct links to each topic.
